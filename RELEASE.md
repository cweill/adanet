# Current version (0.6.0-dev)
 * Under development.

# Release 0.5.0
 * Support training on TPU using `adanet.TPUEstimator`.
 * Allow subnetworks to specify `tf.train.SessionRunHook` instances for training with `adanet.subnetwork.TrainOpSpec`.
 * Add API documentation generation with Sphinx.
 * Fix bug preventing subnetworks with Resource variables from working beyond the first iteration.

# Release 0.4.0
 * Add `shared` field to `adanet.Subnetwork` to deprecate, replace, and be more flexible than `persisted_tensors`.
 * Officially support multi-head learning with or without dict labels.
 * Rebuild the ensemble across iterations in Python without a frozen graph. This allows users to share more than `Tensors` between iterations including Python primitives, objects, and lambdas for greater flexibility. Eliminating reliance on a `MetaGraphDef` proto also eliminates I/O allowing for faster training, and better future-proofing.
 * Allow users to pass custom eval metrics when constructing an `adanet.Estimator`.
 * Add `adanet.AutoEnsembleEstimator` for learning to ensemble `tf.estimator.Estimator` instances.
 * Pass labels to `adanet.subnetwork.Builder`'s `build_subnetwork` method.
 * The TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection will only contain variables relevant to the current `adanet.subnetwork.Builder`, so not passing `var_list` to the `optimizer.minimize` will lead to the same behavior as passing it in by default.
 * Using `tf.summary` inside `adanet.subnetwork.Builder` is now equivalent to using the `adanet.Summary` object.
 * Accessing the `global_step` from within an `adanet.subnetwork.Builder` will return the `iteration_step` variable instead, so that the step starts at zero at the beginning of each iteration. One subnetwork incrementing the step will not affect other subnetworks.
 * Summaries will automatically scope themselves to the current subnetwork's scope. Similar summaries will now be correctly grouped together correctly across subnetworks in TensorBoard. This eliminates the need for the `tf.name_scope("")` hack.
 * Provide an override to force the AdaNet ensemble to grow at the end of each iteration.
 * Correctly seed TensorFlow graph between iterations. This breaks some tests that check the outputs of `adanet.Estimator` models.

# Release 0.3.0
 * Add official support for `tf.keras.layers`.
 * Fix bug that incorrectly pruned colocation constraints between iterations.

# Release 0.2.0
 * Estimator no longer creates eval metric ops in train mode.
 * Freezer no longer converts Variables to constants, allowing AdaNet to handle Variables larger than 2GB.
 * Fixes some errors with Python 3.

# Release 0.1.0
 * Initial AdaNet release.

## Requirements
 * tf-nightly>=1.9.0.dev20180601 || tensorflow>=1.9.0rc0
